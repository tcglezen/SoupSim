# Getting started with SoupSim 

At the moment this is an imcomplete project. In fact, this project has barely been started. The very first commit is simply instantiating the repo so that I could add other members. This commit is going to be setting up the some of the bare bone libraries that we will be using for this project such as CGL. 

Lastly, some folders are purposely empty, namly scene. Scene will contain files (likely .json) that will exist as a "parameter" for our program. It should contain files that exist as a starting state for our program. 

oldsrc contains src from a previous project that we have done with a couple files removed (for academic integrity reasons). src will be the bulk of "graphics work" that we will be working on.
